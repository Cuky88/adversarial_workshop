# Adversarial Workshop

TensorFlow has taken the deep learning world by storm.  This workshop will be led by one of TensorFlow’s main contributors, Illia Polosukhin. Illia’s hands-on workshop will cover:

- Dropout - both for preventing overfitting and as mechanics to get "what model doesn't know" (confidence of prediction).

- Augmenting data with adversarial examples - to prevent overfitting and speed up training

- How to limit technical exploits of your models - e.g. how to use different methods to prevent your model going haywire, using different methods (confidence, adversarial examples, discriminator, separate classifiers or just simple whitelists).
